        <p>"I want our young people to know that they matter, that they belong, so don't be afraid. You hear me? Young people, don't be afraid. Be focused, be determined, be hopeful, be empowered... Lead by example with hope, never fear, and know that I will be with you, rooting for you and working to support you for the rest of my life."</p>
